    This file is one of the most important of the rendering progress.
    It will display the group and the questions inside the group via the for statement that includes question.twig

    Here, you have access to the array aGroup that contains the data of the current group and the array of questions of this group: aQuestions
    To see what's inside aGroup, turn debug mode on and copy the following line to the end of this file:
    {{ dump(aGroup) }}

#}

<!-- START OF GROUP: {{ aGroup.name }} {{ aGroup.gid }}  -->
<div id='group-{{ aGroup.gseq }}' class="{{ aSurveyInfo.class.groupoutercontainer }}{{ aGroup.class }} space-col" {{ aSurveyInfo.attr.questiongroup }}>

    {# The container div itself could often change from a template to another, so we clearly separate it. #}
    {{ include('./subviews/survey/group_subviews/group_container.twig') }}

</div>
<!-- END OF GROUP: {{ aGroup.name }} {{ aGroup.gid }}  -->
